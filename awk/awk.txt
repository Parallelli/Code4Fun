#notes of effective awk programming
a rule constis of a pattern followed by an action.
pattern {action}
awk 'program' input-file1 input-file2
when the program is too long, do
awk -f program-file input-file1 input-file2
//tell shell to start awk and use this program to process input files
//when the awk program is too long, we usually do it by writing it into a awk program and use -f program-file to call it
awk 'program'// you can specify no input file, awk program will treat stdin as its input to process, until EOF (crtl+z)
In awk script, find pattern uses regular expression, which is equivalent to grep in bshell
